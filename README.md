Usage
=======
4. To process data from a binary file captured from rtlsd.py `python3 rtlsd.py` don't forget that arguments are required.

to capture data using rtlsd.py arguments are 
                      
                      -f or --frequency 
                      -t or --time in seconds
                      --output-dir default=./
                      --sample-rate default=2.4e6
                      --gain default=auto doesnt work for me so a number is required

file will be saved as raw_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bin

python process.py the raw file name must be NAME_YYYYMMDD_HHMMMM.bin
                
                arguments for process.py
                    -i or --input, `example python3 process.py -i pathoffile`
                    -o or --output, `example python3 process.py -i pathoffolder -o ./` for local directory
                    -s or --sampling_rate, default: 2.4e6 `which is 2.4mhz`
                    -c or --center_frequency, default: 1420.30e6 `which is 1.4203 ghz`
                
                `example python3 process.py -i file.bin -o ./ -f 1420.30e6 -s 2.4e6`
                
                output of files are:
                    1. heatmap
                    2. frequency spectrum
                    3. signal strength
                    4. preprocessed heatmap

5. aiml.py is ai machine learning althought I am still new at that, It runs but I don't think its working correctly any help would be appreciated
                   
                arguments for aiml.py
                        -a or --server-address default=localhost
                        -p or --server-port default=8888
                        -o or --lnb-offset default=9750e6
                        -f or --frequency default=100e6
                        -g or --gain default=auto but auto doesnt work for me
                        -s or --sampling-frequency default=2.4e6
                        -c or --cutoff-frequency default=1000 cutoff frequency for noise removal
                        -n or --notch-bandwidth default= 100 <--- not implemented
                
                `example python3 process.py -i file.bin -o ./ -f 1420.30e6 -s 2.4e6`

6. range.py is the same as rtlsd.py but instead of just one frenquency it has a low and a high for capture within range

                   arguments for range.py
                       --start-freq
                       --end-freq
                       --sample-rate
                       --duration in seconds
                       --output-dir
           the file created will be binary_raw_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bin

7. analysis.py isn't much but a debug tool for the raw files all it does is print peaks of the signal

                   arguments for analysis.py
                   -i or --input path to binary file must be NAME_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bin
                   -t or --threshold default=0.5


                    
## The server with the conjunction of process output
https://mvia.ca
>>>>>>> origin/main

    Capturing Data:
        Use range.py to capture data over a specified frequency range (ffreq to lfreq).
        Modify ffreq, lfreq, and sfreq in start.sh and start2.sh for different frequency ranges.
        Update IP (ip) and port (port) in server.py for server-side configurations.

    Processing Data:
        Run start.sh or start2.sh to initiate data capture, preprocessing, and analysis.
        Data processing involves using preprocess.py and process5.py to prepare and analyze data files.

    Visualization:
        heatmap.py generates heatmaps based on processed data stored in images/.

    Maintenance:
        Use cleanup.sh for periodic cleaning of unnecessary files or directories (images/, raw/, etc.).

Changing IP and Port in Scripts

To adapt the IP and port settings in server.py, start.sh, and start2.sh:

    Edit Scripts: Open server.py, start.sh, and start2.sh in a text editor.
    Modify IP and Port: Locate variables ip and port.
    Update Values: Replace the existing IP address (ip) and port number (port) with your desired settings.
    Save Changes: After editing, save the scripts with the updated IP and port configurations.

Example:

python

# server.py
ip = '10.10.1.143'
port = 8885

# Update IP and port
ip = 'your_new_ip_address'
port = your_new_port_number

bash

# start.sh or start2.sh
ip=10.10.1.143
port=8885

# Update IP and port
ip="your_new_ip_address"
port=your_new_port_number

Ensure that all instances of IP and port settings are correctly updated across server.py, start.sh, and start2.sh scripts to align with your server configuration and communication requirements.
Notes

    Adjust file paths and script parameters (duration, srf, tol, chunk) as needed for specific data capture and processing requirements.
    Refer to individual script headers or comments for detailed usage instructions and options.
