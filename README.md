Project Name Radio Astronomy with sdr

This project directory contains scripts and files for capturing, processing, and analyzing radio frequency data.
Files and Scripts
Python Scripts:

    aggragate.py: Script for aggregating data or results.
    heatmap.py: Generates heatmaps from captured data.
    process5.py: Processes data files for analysis.
    range.py: Captures data over a specified range of frequencies.
    server.py: Server-side functionality, potentially related to data handling.

Shell Scripts:

    ai.sh: Shell script purpose TBD.
    aggragate.sh: Possibly related to aggragate.py for automation or aggregation tasks.
    cleanup.sh: Script for cleaning up files or managing directories.
    start.sh: Initiates data capture and processing for a specific frequency range.
    start2.sh: Alternative start script for a different frequency range.

Other Files:

    README.md: This documentation file.
    requirements.txt: Contains project dependencies.

Directories:

    images/: Stores output images or visualizations.
    raw/: Directory for storing raw data files.
    pycache/: Automatically generated by Python for bytecode caching.

Usage

    Capturing Data:
        Use range.py to capture data over a specified frequency range (ffreq to lfreq).
        Modify ffreq, lfreq, and sfreq in start.sh and start2.sh for different frequency ranges.
        Update IP (ip) and port (port) in server.py for server-side configurations.

    Processing Data:
        Run start.sh or start2.sh to initiate data capture, preprocessing, and analysis.
        Data processing involves using preprocess.py and process5.py to prepare and analyze data files.

    Visualization:
        heatmap.py generates heatmaps based on processed data stored in images/.

    Maintenance:
        Use cleanup.sh for periodic cleaning of unnecessary files or directories (images/, raw/, etc.).

Changing IP and Port in Scripts

To adapt the IP and port settings in server.py, start.sh, and start2.sh:

    Edit Scripts: Open server.py, start.sh, and start2.sh in a text editor.
    Modify IP and Port: Locate variables ip and port.
    Update Values: Replace the existing IP address (ip) and port number (port) with your desired settings.
    Save Changes: After editing, save the scripts with the updated IP and port configurations.

Example:

python

# server.py
ip = '10.10.1.143'
port = 8885

# Update IP and port
ip = 'your_new_ip_address'
port = your_new_port_number

bash

# start.sh or start2.sh
ip=10.10.1.143
port=8885

# Update IP and port
ip="your_new_ip_address"
port=your_new_port_number

Ensure that all instances of IP and port settings are correctly updated across server.py, start.sh, and start2.sh scripts to align with your server configuration and communication requirements.
Notes

    Adjust file paths and script parameters (duration, srf, tol, chunk) as needed for specific data capture and processing requirements.
    Refer to individual script headers or comments for detailed usage instructions and options.
