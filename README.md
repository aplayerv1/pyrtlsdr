Directories

    images/: Stores output images or visualizations.
    raw/: Directory for storing raw data files.
    pycache/: Automatically generated by Python for bytecode caching.

Usage

Capturing Data:

    Use range.py to capture data over a specified frequency range.
    Modify ffreq, lfreq, and sfreq in config.ini for different frequency ranges.
    Update IP (ip), port (port), and other settings in config.ini for server-side configurations.

Processing Data:

    Run start.py to initiate data capture, preprocessing, and analysis.
    Data processing involves using preprocess.py and process5.py to prepare and analyze data files.

Visualization:

    heatmap.py generates heatmaps based on processed data stored in images/.

Maintenance:

    Use cleanup.sh for periodic cleaning of unnecessary files or directories (images/, raw/, etc.).

Configuration in config.ini

All key settings for the project are stored in the config.ini file. Below is an example configuration:

ini

        [settings]
        ip = 10.10.1.17 (this is the IP address of the server)
        port = 8886     (this is the port number for the server)
        duration = 10   (this is the duration of the data capture sessionm in seconds)
        SRF = 20e6      (this is the sampling rate frequency as float)
        tol = 1600000   (this is the tolerance value for frequency adjustments)
        chunk = 2048    (this is the chunk size for processing data)
        workers = 4     (this is the number of worker threads or processes)
        lat = 41.157940 (this is the latitude of the observation site)
        lon = 8.464160  (this is the longitude of the observation site)
        base_directory = /home/server/rtl/pyrtl      (this is the directory where the data is stored)
        nas_images_dir = /mnt/nas/tests/processed    (this is the directory where the images are stored)
        nas_raw_dir = /mnt/nas/tests/capture         (this is the directory where the raw data is stored)

Key Parameters:

    ip: IP address for server connections.
    port: Port number for server connections.
    duration: Duration of data capture sessions. (in seconds)
    SRF: Sampling rate frequency. 
    tol: Tolerance value for frequency adjustments.
    chunk: Data chunk size for processing.
    workers: Number of worker threads or processes. 
    lat, lon: Latitude and longitude coordinates of the observation site.
    base_directory: Base directory for local data storage.
    nas_images_dir: Network-attached storage directory for processed images. (this is to move images to a NAS recommended to use a NAS)
    nas_raw_dir: Network-attached storage directory for raw data capture. (this is to move raw to a NAS recommended to use a NAS)

Changing Settings in config.ini

To modify the projectâ€™s configuration:

    Edit config.ini: Open config.ini in a text editor.
    Modify Desired Values: Adjust the IP address, port, or any other settings as needed.
    Save Changes: After editing, save the config.ini file with the updated configurations.

Example Update:

To change the IP address and port:

ini

    [settings]
    ip = your_new_ip_address
    port = your_new_port_number

After updating the config.ini file, the project will use the new IP address and port for server connections.
Remember to restart the project or relevant scripts after making changes to config.ini for the updated settings to take effect.

The frequency_ranges array in your code is a list of tuples, each representing a specific frequency range with additional metadata. Each tuple has the following format:

(start, stop, center, name, low_cutoff, high_cutoff)

Here's what each parameter represents:
must be in float format:

    start: The starting frequency of the range (in Hz).
    stop: The ending frequency of the range (in Hz).
    center: The center frequency of the range (in Hz).
    name: A descriptive name or label for the frequency range.
    low_cutoff: The lower cutoff frequency (in Hz), which might be used for filtering or identifying the valid signal range.
    high_cutoff: The upper cutoff frequency (in Hz), also used for filtering or identifying the valid signal range.

Modifying Frequency Ranges

To modify the frequency range:

    Open start.py.
    Locate the ffreq, lfreq, and sfreq values.
    Adjust these values according to the specific frequency ranges you want to modify.

For example, if you want to change the range of the "1420MHz_HI" frequency, you would modify its tuple:

python

    (1420.20e6, 1420.60e6, 1420.40e6, "1420MHz_HI", 1420.00e6, 1420.80e6)

Example Adjustments

    Change the center frequency to 1420.50e6:

    python

    (1420.20e6, 1420.60e6, 1420.50e6, "1420MHz_HI", 1420.00e6, 1420.80e6)

Expand the range by increasing the stop frequency to 1420.70e6 and the high cutoff to 1420.90e6:

python

    (1420.20e6, 1420.70e6, 1420.45e6, "1420MHz_HI", 1420.00e6, 1420.90e6)

Repeat this for any frequency range you need to modify by adjusting the start, stop, center, low_cutoff, and high_cutoff values as required.


This documentation now accurately describes the usage of config.ini for managing the project's configuration settings.
